        <h1>Atoms and How They Form Elements</h1>
        <p>
          Quick review on matter: matter is anything that has mass and occupies space.
          The mass of an object is how much of that object there is, and can be measured using gravity.
          Gravity pulls on every bit of an object's matter equally, meaning the more mass an object has, the more force it exhibits.
          Therefore if we know the force of gravity somewhere, we can measure how it affects an object and determine its mass.
          That force being measured is that object's weight, NOT its mass, because weight depends on gravity and mass does not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Atoms are forms of matter made of three main components: <strong>electrons</strong>, <strong>neutrons</strong>, and <strong>protons</strong>.
          The <strong>nucleus</strong>, or center of the atom, is composed of neutrons and protons, and is orbited by electrons.
          Every stable atom must have an equal number of protons and electrons, but any amount of neutrons it can hold.
          The number of protons an atom has defines its elemental number, or what type of atom it is.
          The number of neutrons is not important in this context however, so I will ignore it.
          An atom with 1 proton, for example, would have to have 1 electron, and would be element 1: Hydrogen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Atoms can also form <strong>ions</strong>, which are unstable atoms that contain an uneven amount of protons and electrons, giving the atom a slightly positive or negative charge overall.
          There are two types: <strong>cations</strong> and <strong>anions</strong>, which have positive and negative charges respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Atoms will always gain or lose their <strong>valence</strong>, or outermost, electrons first.
          When an atom has a full valence shell, or usually 8 valence electrons, it tends not to bond with other atoms.
          However, any valence electrons may be shared or transferred with other atoms, causing them to bond together.
          There are also two types of bonds: <strong>ionic</strong> bonds and <strong>covalent</strong> bonds.
          An ionic bond will cause its hosts to become ions, specifically one a cation and the other an anion, because one atom gave the other an electron.
          These bonds do not tend to be strong, and are usually known as <strong>salts</strong>.
          Whereas, a covalent bond will cause its hosts to share electrons, and is prefixed (single, double, triple, etc.) based on how many of those electrons are shared.
          Covalnent bonds are the strongest atomic bonds, but there are two different types: <strong>nonpolar</strong> where electrons are shared equally, like diatomic oxygen, and <strong>polar</strong>, where one atom shares more electrons than the other.

        <h1>The Essential Elements of Life</h1>
        <p>
          Six of these elements are found prominently in all life, and are essential for its existance.
          These elements in order of proportion of mass are: Oxygen, Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Calcium, and Phosphorus.
          This creates the acronym OCHNCaP, but the more commonly used acronym is CHONCaP.
          Also, the Essential Elements in the order of proportion of atoms found are: Hydrogen, Oxygen, Carbon, Nitrogen, Calcium, and Phosphorus.
          In truth, I have no idea why.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h2>Oxygen</h2>
            <p>
              We breath Oxygen, as it is another vital component of cellular respiration, and is the waste product of photosynthesis.
              It is also the second component of water, making it an important part of life.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Carbon</h2>
            <p>
              Carbon is most known in the molecule Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), but is by definition in "all" living things.
              From what we can observe, living beings have to be carbon-based, so it is quite possibly the most important element of them all.
              Specifically, Carbon is the backbone of organic macromolecules.
              Also, Carbon Dioxide is a waste product of cellular respiration, or a required molecule for plants' photosynthesis.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Hydrogen</h2>
            <p>
              Hydrogen is the largest part of the most abundant molecule in the human body: water!
              Water is 2 parts Hydrogen and one part Oxygen, so in just water there is twice as much Hydrogen.
              Water also is an <strong>electron carrier</strong>, important part of macromolecules, and has a pH of 7.0, and when it has lost an electron, becomes acidic.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Nitrogen</h2>
            <p>
              Nitrogen is found in proteins, the workers of cells, urine, a way for animals to expell waste, and nuclec acids, huge macromolecules that store instructions for proteins.
              Plants require it to grow, which is why in some soils, you will see small yellow pellets, that contain Nitrogen in them as "plant food."
              It is also not only found in nucleic acids, but actually the basis for them.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Calcium</h2>
            <p>
              Calcium is found most commonly in dairy products, which we ingest to help keep our bones strong, help muscles and other cells communiate/contract, and regulate our blood pH balance.
              However, an absense of calcium will cause rigor mortis.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Phosphorus</h2>
            <p>
              Phosphorus is most prominently in ATP, or adenosine triphosphate.
              ATP is what our mitochondria convert mainly Glucose into, which is used to transfer energy or power our cells, almost like the "cell currency."

        <h1>The Biomolecules</h1>
        <p>
          Macromolecules are known as the "molecules of life" (Biomolecules).
          A macromolecule is a large molecule, and most organic compounds are macromolecules.
          These molecules run life processes such as metabolism and reproduction, based on these molecules' behaviors.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is an organic compound?
          Really, any compound that occurs naturally in life.
          It's not a very solid definition, but neither is the definition for states of matter.
          However, to help with this definition, all organic compounds have a carbon backbone, otherwise the compound would be an inorganic macromolecule.
          If you notice in the pictures, every macromolecule has carbon in the middle, even looking like a backbone.
          Organic compounds will also usually include at least one Hydrogen, Oxygen, or Nitrogen atom.
        </p>
        <p>
          These organic molecules are built from building blocks called monomers, which are single molecules with the ability to chain or combine with other similar molecules.
          A connected chain of monomers is called a polymer.
          All macromolecules are polymers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of these organic macromolecules, there are four different types: Carbohydrates, Lipids, Proteins, and Nucleic Acids.
          Every single one of these is absolutely vital to life.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
              <p>
                Also known as sugars, are made from carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
                The monomer forms of carbohydrates are called <strong>monosaccharides</strong>, or simple sugars, and give immediate energy.
                Specifically, monosaccharides are Glucose and Fructose.
                There are also sugar chains made from two monomers, called <strong>disaccharides</strong>, like Sucrose and Lactose.
                Of course, there are also polymer versions of sugars, called <strong>polysaccharides</strong>, which are any sugar chains with more than 2 links.
                These include starches in plants, glycogen in animals, cellulose, and chitin.
                The longer a sugar chaing is, the harder it is to break down, and polysaccharides are most commonly referred to as "complex carbohydrates."
                These can be so hard to digest, in fact, that they become fiber (aren't digested at all), like cellulose and chitin.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2>Proteins</h2>
              <p>
                Proteins are macromolecules that actually function, like storing substances, creating structures, defending a cell, transportation, and enzymes.
                Proteins as monomers are called <strong>amino acids</strong>, and as polymers, <strong>polypeptide</strong>.
                Polypeptides are usually structural proteins or functional proteins, like enzymes.
                Also, proteins are made of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2>Lipids</h2>
              <p>
                Lipids are fat molecules, made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
                They serve to store long-term energy, as a mass of lipids contains twice as much energy as that same mass in carbohydrates.
                A huge property about lipids is that they do not dissolve in water, because they have both polar and non-polar ends.
                The monomer forn of a lipid is a fatty acid, or glycerol, and as a polymer: saturated fat, unsaturated fat, steroid, wax, or a phospholipid.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2>Nucleic Acid</h2>
              <p>
                Nucleic acids are made of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus.
                Their function is to store and transfer information for all cell activities, like programming modules for a computer.
                As monomers, they are calle nucleoties, consisting of a sugar, phosphate, and a nitrogen base.
                As a polymer, depending on the presence of oxygen, are either named deoxyribonucleicacid (DNA)(without oxygen), or simply ribonucleicacid (RNA)(with oxygen).
                Anything that lives, has some form of RNA or DNA, otherwise it would not do anything, and therefore wouldn't live.

        <h1>The Properties of Water</h1>
        <p>
          Water is an important molecule in life, because of its structure: H<sub>2</sub>O, or two hydrogen atoms bonded to an oxygen atom.
          Oxygen is missing two electrons in its valence shell, so it needs to borrow one each from the hydrogen atoms, and each hydrogen atom needs a single electron, so each atomic bond in water is a single polar covalent bond.
          Instead, the single oxygen molecule, as it is larger, tends to "hog" the shared electrons, making the hydrogen atoms "unsatisfied."
          This means water is a polar molecule, with the hydrogen atoms more positive and the oxygen atoms more negative.
          Almost like affair, the hydrogen atoms are attracted to other molecules' hydrogen atoms, creating intermolecular hydrogen bonds.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for water in life, it may compose anywhere from 60% to 95% of living beings, with jellyfish taking the maximum 95%.
          The human body only contains about 65% water, but is still just as necessary, as water is a major cell component.
          Water is also found in DNA.
          It also has the properties of cohesion/adhesion, high specific heat moderation, being a universal solvent, and expansion on freezing.
          Hydrogen is responsible for three of these properties:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h2>High Specific Heat</h2>
            <p>
              This means water resists changes in temperature.
              This is important because it means water can absorb a significant amount of heat, which helps regulate temperatures in cells.
              This also helps regulate our climate and help cells prevent from freezing.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Cohesion</h2>
            <p>
              Cohesion is the attraction among molecules of a substnce.
              This is used in plants to help transfer water along stems/trunks, and currently, it is impossible to live without plants.
              Specifically, water climbs itself up a tree through Capillary Action.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Adhesion</h2>
            <p>
              Adhesion is the attraction among molecules of different substances.
              Also used in plants, this is usually known as Surface Tension.
              It causes water to easily form droplets on surfaces and run off.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Water is the Universal Solvent</h2>
            <p>
              Many compounds dissolve in water, like sugar, or salt.
              And in life, ions and molecules can only be part of the chemical processes of life if they are dissolved in water.
              In the process of dissolution, you have two parts: a <strong>solvent</strong>, the substance with the greatest presence and dissolves solutes, and a <strong>solute</strong>, the substance that dissolves in a solvent.
              In our blood, when used as a solvent for polar molecules like sugars and proteins, will break them down.
              This process is absolutely vital for cell processes.
              However, fats and oils are nonpolar, so they usually do not dissolve in water ("oil and water don't mix").
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Expansion on Freezing</h2>
            <p>
              Objects usually contract when they are cooled down, but water actually expands.
              This is because the aforementioned hydrogen bonds are strong enough to crystallize the water when the water molecules aren't shaking as much.
              Because of this, ice floats on water, and can actually insulate anything living underneath it.
            </p>

        <h1>The pH Scale</h1>
        <p>
          The pH scale is a way of quantifying the acidity of a substance.
          Specifically, you would measure for OH- and H+ ions.
          These ions are formed from water, as spliting water would give you OH and H.
          The - and + simply shows whether or not the ion is positive or negative.
          Acids are substances with more H+ ions than OH- ions, and bases are the opposite.
          Obviously pure water is an equal amount, usually because the ions would bond together and cancel each other out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Acids have a pH value of anywhere between 1 and 7, but not including 7.
          Usually acids taste sour, and are corrosive, which is why they are used to break down other substances.
          Your own stomach is a great example of this.
          It contains mostly hydrochloric acid to break down the food you have eaten.
          Hydrochloric acid is very strong, and actually brings your stomach's pH value down to 1 or 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bases have a pH value of anywhere between 7 and 14, but again, not including 7.
          These contain more OH- ions, and are usually bitter and slippery.
          Bases are most commonly used in cleaning products, and when added to acids, neutralize each other, and the ions neutralize each other creating water.
